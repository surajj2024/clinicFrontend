For patients who prefer to visit the clinic in person, they have the option to request the reception staff to assist in booking appointments. In such cases, the staff will need to input the patient's registered email ID, which will serve as the basis for scheduling the appointment.

### Cancel Appointment

The staff has the capability on the patient's request to cancel appointments by entering the patient's email ID. Upon submission of the email ID, a list of all the cancellable appointments of the patient will be displayed. This allows the staff to efficiently manage and accommodate appointment cancellations based on the patient's preferences.

### Make Payment
