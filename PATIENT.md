When patients click on the "View Location" tab on their dashboard, an interactive Google Map will open, displaying the precise location of the hospital. This feature helps patients easily find their way to the hospital and ensures a smooth navigation experience.

### Book Appointment

Patients can conveniently schedule appointments online through the system. Upon clicking the "Book Appointment" tab, a list of available doctors will be displayed. To further enhance user experience, patients have the option to filter doctors based on their respective departments. After selecting both the preferred appointment date and the desired department, the list of available doctors for that specific day and department will appear. Clicking the "BOOK" button will lead the user to the payment page. Once payment is successfully processed, the appointment is confirmed and will be visible under the "My Appointments" tab.

In instances where payment is not made during the booking process, patients have the flexibility to choose between two options. They can either make a self-payment before the appointment date by using the "Make Payment" tab, or opt for an offline payment by visiting the hospital and coordinating with the reception staff.

### Make Payment
